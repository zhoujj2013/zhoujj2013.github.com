# Microbiome, Microbiota analysis

## Basic concept

+ Microbiota: microrganisms living in a particular habitat;
+ Microbiome: the genomes of microbiota;
+ Metagenomics: 
    + Classical - a collection of genes sequenced from the environment analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single genome;
    + Recent - the application of modern genomics techniques to the study of communities of microbial organisms directly in their natural environments, bypassing the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species;
+ Partnership:
   + Mutualism: both partners benefit from the relationship;
   + Parasitism: one organism (the parasite) benefits while to other organism (the host) is hurt;
    + Commensalism: one organism benefits while the other is unaffected;
    + Altruism: one organism benefits while the other is hurt.
+ Biofilms promote altruism:
    + Biofilms are communities of microorganisms in a matrix that joins them together and to living or inert substrates, assuming phenotypes distinct from those of planktonic cells;
    + Bacteria will often sacrifice their maximum growth rate in an effort to use the available community resources more efficiently;
    + While individuals are disadvantaged, community as a whole benefits;
+ Pan-genome â€“ global gene repertoire of a bacterial species
    + Core genome + Dispensable Genome;
    + Core genome: genes shared by all strains of the same species;
    + Dispensable genome: consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes, i.e. genes present in some but not all of the same species

## Method

+ 16S rRNA sequencing
+ Higher statistical power of description
+ More closely define the subject under description and by reducing the scale of observation thus reduce the impact of noise
+ Define and describe mechanisms that lead to this diversity and make it more tractable

## Applications

+ Probiotics: Live microorganisms which when ingested in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.
+ Taxonomy: The challenges in bacterial taxonomy
    + Pathology driven problematic classifications
    + Genus too large
    + Mixtures of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species
    + Definition of "Species"
    + Numerical Taxonomy
