# Mapping protein interaction of yeast to protein complex and functional pathway

## Background

+ Previous research had reported that protein interactions in highly related to genetic interaction[1][#1], [2][#2];
+ Protein interaction form protein complexes and enzymes can catalytic the metabolic, so it's a popular to interprets genetic interaction by integrated protein interaction network;

## Methology

### Collection data

+ [BioGrid](http://thebiogrid.org/);

### Method

+ [Referring to genetic interaction](./2013.02.01-Mapping_genetic_interaction_of_yeast_to_protein_complexes_and_functional_pathways.html) [3][#3].
