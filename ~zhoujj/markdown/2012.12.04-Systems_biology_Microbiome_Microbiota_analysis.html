<h1>Microbiome, Microbiota analysis</h1>

<h2>Basic concept</h2>

<ul>
<li>Microbiota: microrganisms living in a particular habitat;</li>
<li>Microbiome: the genomes of microbiota;</li>
<li>Metagenomics: 
<ul>
<li>Classical - a collection of genes sequenced from the environment analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single genome;</li>
<li>Recent - the application of modern genomics techniques to the study of communities of microbial organisms directly in their natural environments, bypassing the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Partnership:
<ul>
<li>Mutualism: both partners benefit from the relationship;</li>
<li>Parasitism: one organism (the parasite) benefits while to other organism (the host) is hurt;</li>
<li>Commensalism: one organism benefits while the other is unaffected;</li>
<li>Altruism: one organism benefits while the other is hurt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Biofilms promote altruism:
<ul>
<li>Biofilms are communities of microorganisms in a matrix that joins them together and to living or inert substrates, assuming phenotypes distinct from those of planktonic cells;</li>
<li>Bacteria will often sacrifice their maximum growth rate in an effort to use the available community resources more efficiently;</li>
<li>While individuals are disadvantaged, community as a whole benefits;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pan-genome â€“ global gene repertoire of a bacterial species
<ul>
<li>Core genome + Dispensable Genome;</li>
<li>Core genome: genes shared by all strains of the same species;</li>
<li>Dispensable genome: consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes, i.e. genes present in some but not all of the same species</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<ul>
<li>16S rRNA sequencing</li>
<li>Higher statistical power of description</li>
<li>More closely define the subject under description and by reducing the scale of observation thus reduce the impact of noise</li>
<li>Define and describe mechanisms that lead to this diversity and make it more tractable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<ul>
<li>Probiotics: Live microorganisms which when ingested in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.</li>
<li>Taxonomy: The challenges in bacterial taxonomy
<ul>
<li>Pathology driven problematic classifications</li>
<li>Genus too large</li>
<li>Mixtures of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species</li>
<li>Definition of "Species"</li>
<li>Numerical Taxonomy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
