# Mapping genetic interaction of yeast to protein complex and functional pathway

## Background 

+ Positive interaction and negative interaction tend to be group into pathway/complex or between pathway and complex.[1][#1]
+ Positive interaction and negative interaction can also be grouped into metabolic pathway, FBA analysis can explain part of negative and positive interaction.[2][#2]
+ Mapping genetic interaction into groups is the fundamental to provide insight into the istribution and monochromaticity of genetic interactions between functional groups.[2][#2][3][#3]

## Methodology

### Data collection

+ Download curated data from SGD website [download](http://www.yeastgenome.org/download-data/curation);
+ Download the interaction data from [BioGrid](http://thebiogrid.org/)[4][#4];
+ Download the pathway interaction data from [KEGG PATHWAY](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and I developed a program to get the gene belong to every pathway of yeast through the [REST](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html) service. [download the program](https://github.com/zhoujj2013/CBAKit/KEGGrest)
+ Download the protein complex data from multi-source[1][#1],[5][#5],[6][#6],[7][#7],[8][#8]. 

### Method

+ Grouping genes into the complex and pathway directly[1][#1], [2][#2];
+ Monochromatic analysis[1][#1], [2][#2];

[Genetic interaciton distribution in protein complexes and biological pathways]

+ There are 189,692 genetic interaction, about 125,000 are negative and 32,000 are positive interactions;
+ About half of the positive/negative genetic interactions can group into protein complexes;
+ Only a few genetic interactions can group into biological pathways;
+ Many genetic interactions can't map to protein complexes and pathways;
+ Maybe we can use the protein complexes information to assist genetic interaction mapping to pathway.


## Some puzzle things

+ What is term "Monochromatic analysis" means?
+ Is complex-complex interaction analysis meaningful?
