<h1>Disease Network Analysis</h1>

<h2>Origin of Disease Network Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>Social Links and Club Membership
<ul>
<li>Social connections are pairwise;</li>
<li>However, most acquaintances are formed within social clubs;</li>
<li>Social clubs provide the opportunity to create social connections.</li>
<li>Club membership is crucial for social network formation.Clubs: family, university, gym, series of conferences, hobby, etc.</li>
<li>Many people have multiple memberships;</li>
<li>They can communicate through a third party which shares a club with both;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just like disease, different disease have different related genes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2-mode to 1-mode conversion</h2>

<ul>
<li>http://toreopsahl.com/tnet/</li>
<li>The skin disease, Costello et al 2009 Science</li>
</ul>

<h2>Systems medicine: basic hypothesis</h2>

<ul>
<li>Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</li>
<li>a system of cataloging 1000+ human monogenic and complex diseases and 1500+ associated genetic mutations http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</li>
<li>disease genes more likely to encode hubs in the cellular network</li>
<li>Essential Proteins are Hubs: Disease Genes are at the Network Periphery;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topological properties of disease genes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cancer genes: greater connectivity and centrality (Jonsson and Bates, ‘06)</li>
<li>Only essential disease genes show higher connectivities(Goh et al., ‘07)</li>
<li>Disease genes have similar graphlet degree signatures in PPI networks (Milenkovic and Przulj, ‘08)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drug discovery</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drugs and drug targets</li>
<li>FDA Approved discovery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>The summary is too simple;</li>
<li>Read other paper to enrich the knowledge;</li>
</ul>
