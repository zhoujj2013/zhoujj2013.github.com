Examples of A) Betweenness centrality, B) Closeness centrality, C) Eigenvector centrality, D) Degree centrality, E) Harmonic Centrality and F) Katz centrality of the same graph.

- Betweenness centrality

  Betweenness is a centrality measure of a vertex within a graph (there is also edge betweenness, 
which is not discussed here). Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as 
a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.

- Closeness centrality

In a connected graph, the normalized closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is the average 
length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus the more central 
a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

- Eigenvector centrality

  Eigenvector centrality (also called eigencentrality) is a measure of the influence of a node in a 
network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections
to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to 
low-scoring nodes.

- Degree centrality

  Historically first and conceptually simplest is degree centrality, which is defined as the number
of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).

- Harmonic Centrality

- Katz centrality

  Katz centrality[19] is a generalization of degree centrality. Degree centrality measures the number 
of direct neighbors, and Katz centrality measures the number of all nodes that can be connected through 
a path, while the contributions of distant nodes are penalized.
