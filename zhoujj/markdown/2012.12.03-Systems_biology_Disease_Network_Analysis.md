# Disease Network Analysis

## Origin of Disease Network Analysis

+ Social Links and Club Membership
    + Social connections are pairwise;
    + However, most acquaintances are formed within social clubs;
    + Social clubs provide the opportunity to create social connections.
    + Club membership is crucial for social network formation.Clubs: family, university, gym, series of conferences, hobby, etc.
    + Many people have multiple memberships;
    + They can communicate through a third party which shares a club with both;
+ Just like disease, different disease have different related genes.
+ We can assume disease is the club and the members of club is genes.
+ The properties of club can transfer to disease research.

## Method convert Tow-mode information to One-mode network

+ 2-mode to 1-mode conversion
	+ Tools: http://toreopsahl.com/tnet/
	+ The skin disease, Costello et al 2009 Science

## Systems medicine: basic hypothesis

+ Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ([OMIM][omim]), include many disease gene and mutation;

+ Limitations of Genome-wide association study (GWAS);
+ A system of cataloging 1000+ human monogenic and complex diseases and 1500+ associated genetic mutations; 
+ Disease genes not likely to encode hubs in the cellular network;
+ Essential Proteins are Hubs: Disease Genes are at the Network Periphery;

## Topological properties of disease genes

+ Cancer genes: greater connectivity and centrality (Jonsson and Bates, ‘06)
+ Only essential disease genes show higher connectivities(Goh et al., ‘07)
+ Disease genes have similar graphlet degree signatures in PPI networks (Milenkovic and Przulj, ‘08)

## Drug discovery

+ Drugs and drug targets;
+ The majority of drugs shared targets with other drugs;
+ FDA Approved discovery;

## Summary

+ The summary is too simple;
+ Read other paper to enrich the knowledge;
