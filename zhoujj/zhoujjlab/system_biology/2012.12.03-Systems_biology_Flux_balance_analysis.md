# Flux Balance Analysis

## Concept

+ Flux Balance Analysis:A mathematical method for analyzing metabolism. It is a direct application of linear programming to biological systems that uses the stoichiometric coefficients for each reaction in the system as the set of constraints for the optimization.

+ What is a model?
	+ "A representation of the essential aspects of an existing system(or a system to be constructed) which represents knowledge of that system in a usable form" (Evkhoff, 1974)
	+ Mathematical model vs. statistical model

+ Aims
	+ Predicting knockout phenotypes
	+ Quantitative Flux Prediction
	+ Predict the effects of drugs on metabolism
	+ Many infectious disease processes involve microbial metabolic changes

## Metabolic network reconstruction Method 

Use universal reaction stoichiometries to predict network metabolic capabilities at steady state.

+ Metabolites:

>matrix[A  B  C  D]

+ Reactions:

>2A + B -> C;

>C -> D;

+ Stoichiometry Vectors(matrix):

>matrix[ -2  -1  1  0 ]

>matrix[  0  0  -1  1 ]

+ Reversible reactions are represented by two reactions that proceed in each direction;
+ Exchange reactions allow for fluxes from/into an infinite pool outside the system
+ Reaction reprecentation:

>dx/dt = S*V

>V is a vector of fluxes through each reaction

>Then S*V is a vector describing the change in concentration of each metabolite per unit time

		+ Verify reaction directionality;
		+ Assignment of reaction to cellular compartments;
		+ Develop gene-protein-reaction relationship;
	+ conversion of Network to Mathematical model
		+ Mathematical representation via mass balance;
		+ Definition of systems boundaries;
		+ Biomass Reaction;
		+ Apply constraints to the system for performing FBA;
	+ Model validation

## Application

+ Knockout Phenotype Prediction
+ Quantitative Flux Predictions

## Limitation of FBA

+ It does not use kinetic parameters, it cannot predict metabolite concentrations. 
+ It is only suitable for determining fluxes at steady state. 
+ Except in some modified forms, FBA does not account for regulatory effects such as activation of enzymes by protein kinases or regulation of gene expression.
